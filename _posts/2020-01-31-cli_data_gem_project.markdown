During my time here at Flatiron School, we have been learning to code by completing labs that come with test that you need to pass. 

I guess you could say that these tests, especially since a lot of them were inside of the Learm IDE, were very basic and direct. Basic in a sense that everything that you needed to complete the lab was inside of the browser, and there was very little outside work that had to be done on your part. 

Then everything changed. 

I remember seeing the "Portfolio Project" section headline on top of the dashboard, and thinking to myself that this is something kind of far away? It was a tangible thing, but at the same time didn't feel real? Usually dates and deadlines become more of a real thing to me the closer it is until they are here. Ha. This was no different. 

I thought that by the time that the project week would commence, I would know everything that  would need to know to complete it. I thought that, by  the time it was here, I would have a strong mastery of the skills that I would need to do this. I was wrong. I needed more time, and help, and everything else. 

From not knowing the topic of my porject, to finding one and then changing it three times, there was a lot of doubt in my mind as to whether or not I could actually complete it correctly--not even thinking about if I could complete it on time. 

So, the project, what was it, and how did I complete it. 



***A Tribute to My Favorite Youtuber***

I wanted my CLI Data Gem to be fun. I thought that even though learning about concepts that are honestly not the most exciting, how could I make this CLI something fun, and that I could actually use. (I saw a video talking about how I should make this into something that could solve a potential business need, but I wasn't that solid in my fundamentals to even attempt that yet.) So I decided the next big question in my life at the moment that I needed answered was "What should I eat for lunch?" 

A simple question, yet not so simple answer--depending on you who ask. However, I already knew where to look for my answer. That was "The Report of the Week's Youtube channel.  I loved the reviews, and so I wondered if there was anything I could do with that. 

I looked around to see if there was an API that had information that I could use, or if I could scrape another site that had it. It wasn't until sitting down with my instructor that allowed me to find one. 

So I made my project with it. Planning out what I wanted my user to be able to do, to the objects that I wanted made--these were all neccesary to completing it. 

I struggled alot. Not neccesarily knowing which "array of hashes" did this, or why JSON wasn't giving me the relevant information that I wanted. It was tough, but I finally got it down. 

I can say that I learned alot, and in the future I would have done a lot of things differently. I guess that's the beauty in this? Working hard trying to learn and understand concepts, to implementing them, and then finally that AHA moment when everything makes sense? Priceless.
