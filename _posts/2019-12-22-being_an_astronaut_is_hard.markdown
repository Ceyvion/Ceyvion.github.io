I have, for as long as I remember, wanted answers to the questions that naturally come as one gets older. 

> Why is this the way that it is? 

> What makes this thing work? 
> 
> Why does this do that versus 
> 
> Why does that do this? 

Questions like these have become extremely important to me as I now navigate my adult life. As I look around at the world around me, I continually find inspiration to ask these questions--yet, up until now, I haven't had a way to properly express my concerns.

*Then I found Code, or Software Development*

I distinctly remember a time when I was younger when eveything with a screen fascinated me. I had the frist Android device, and just having that would sustain me for hours. It unfortunately broke, and I was sad, but I remembered all that I did with it. 

Having the power of technology in the palm of hands was something that brought me great joy. I toyed with it--seeing what was inside, and what made it worked was an everyday activity. I came home from school (I didn't want to bring it to school in fear of losing it) and immediatley started tinkering with it. I never knew what I was doing at first, but with most things, practice can unlock a new set of questions--it made me more introspective, as it related to this handheld device, and all that I could do with it. After countless ROMS, tweaks, and customization's, I realised that the excitement was dewindling, I wasn't as nearly satisified with with the device as I once was. I needed more, but I didn't know where to look. 

**To Space! ... or the Apple Store**

Software on the device that I had at the time was very limited. I had exhausted article after article as it related to designing my Android in the way that I wanted it. It wasn;'t pretty. It was usuable for sure, just wasn't "aesthethically pleasing" to my 14 year old eye. These wants of a stylized operating system drew my eyes towards the idealogically rival of Android--iOS. I thought that this was something that seemed more put together, more pleasing to look at--yet I didn't have a device to tinker with. 



I eventually saved enough money from my summer job to go to the Apple Store and purchase my first device. This was it, the moment that I was waiting for! I enthusicastically went home and opened the box, my excitement was at an all time high. Then it happened. I was sitting in my room, looking at my shiny new iPhone 4. Everything about it really made me happy. To have a piece of sophisticated techin my hand was something that I would cherish long after this device.



**Stepping on the Moon, is this all that I'm capable of?**



When Neil Armstrong stepped on the Moon and uttered that famous phrase: "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.", I can only imagine what he felt in that moment, was he scared? Happy? Or was something missing? Could mankind go farther than the Moon, and as it pertains to me--Could I go farther in my love for software than just tweaking someone else's work? Could the changes that I implemented on my personal device be someday made an official part of an OS? I'm not sure, I'm not sure of my capabilities yet, but I know that just as man has made it's way to Mars, and sent satellites to Jupiter and beyond--it just takes time. Maybe, just maybe, I'll discover my own planet.
